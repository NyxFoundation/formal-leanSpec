Sync-service state machine.

Mirrors `src/lean_spec/node/sync/states.py` (`SyncState` and its
`accepts_gossip` property) and the transition guard of
`src/lean_spec/node/sync/service.py` (`SyncService._transition_to`):

    IDLE -> SYNCING -> SYNCED
      ^         |         |
      +---------+---------+

  - IDLE: no peers connected, or shutdown requested.
  - SYNCING: active block processing and backfill driven by gossip.
  - SYNCED: caught up to the network finalized slot.

`_transition_to` validates a *requested* move rather than computing the
next state: it rejects self-transitions and the IDLE → SYNCED shortcut
(SYNCING must run before SYNCED is reached) and accepts every other
pair, including any active state falling back to IDLE. Python raises
`ValueError` on a forbidden move; the model returns `none`.

Proves SYNC-1 from `docs/lean4-proof-propositions.md`:
  - SYNC-1: the sync FSM only takes the permitted transitions — every
    move the guard accepts lies in the catalog's `canTransitionTo`
    relation (`transition_sound`). Upstream is in fact stricter than
    that relation: it also rejects the idle self-loop the relation's
    `any_to_idle` admits — `transitionTo_ne` records the
    no-self-transition invariant.
